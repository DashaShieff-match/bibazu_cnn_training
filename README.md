# bibazu_cnn_training

This package contains code for training neural networks to be used in aerodynamic part feeding. They are used for detecting the orientation of parts visually so they can be re-oriented arbitrarily.

## User input and configuration parameters
+ Training and validation datasets
+ Neural Net Architecture
+ Augmentations
+ Training parameters

## Output
+ Trained network for live orientation classification

## Local
use the `bibazu_ml_training.ipynb` notebook

## Google Colab
+ open the other notebook in google colab
+ clone the example data repo seperately !git clone ...
+ add your own training data
+ export your trained nets
